				       With growing technology, quantum physics has one of the most significant impacts on our world. It studies a completely different world than the that we live in, the smallest particles in the universe.
According to its definition, a quantum is “The smallest amount of a physical quantity, such as energy, that can exist independently, or this amount used as a unit of measurement.” But the reality is far beyond the definition.   This science enables us to create and build new data worlds for the future and every aspect of life.
The most mind-blowing advance is that it brings a powerful tool: the quantum computer. With this development, quantum computers will be able to solve complex problems faster, more accurately, and even issues that advanced computers are not able to solve.
Another point is that the way we process the information, by using qubits, computers will solve millions of problems, using a parallel computing system. These improvements have a high potential in fields like medicine, AI, economics, climate change, and more.
With the power of these computers, we can predict the risks in market failures and reshape how economic decisions are made; change which supplies will be produced, and how they will be produced without any drawbacks.
As quantum technology develops, economists are now forced to rethink some fundamental concepts. For instance, if access to information becomes very rapid and widespread, some resources may no longer be "scarce." Nevertheless, the amount of energy usage could cause an opposite trend.
						This essay emphasizes that the growing advanced quantum physics is beginning to influence every aspect of the world, and this project demonstrates the relation between modern economics. By combining microeconomic concepts with real world examples from quantum development, this project aims to make the relations between science and economics clearer and underline the significance.

Quantum technology is not just a scientific discovery; it's an economic development. As we enter this new technological world, economists, governments, and businesses will have to redo their improvements and policies. The connection between quantum and economics may no longer seem elective; it may become unavoidable.     </div>
