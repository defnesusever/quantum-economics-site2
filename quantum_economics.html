        <h2>1. Competitive Markets: Demand and Supply</h2>

        <p>The quantum computing market is still in its infancy globally, but it is growing rapidly. Major companies are producing early-stage quantum processors. The demand for quantum encryption and machine learning, especially in finance, defense, and health, is increasing. However, supply is constrained due to rare materials and the low technical capacity of companies, driving up prices. This results in a short-term disequilibrium in the market. As competition increases-for instance, startups such as Rigetti or European academic labs-we anticipate both supply and demand curves to shift and finally arrive at a competitive market.</p>

        <h2>2-Elasticities(PED,YED,PES)</h2>

        <p>Quantum products usually have inelastic demand because they are unique and have few substitutes. Companies and governments are more likely to spend more on cybersecurity or significant computing systems, and even though they are expensive, they will still buy quantum systems. These are often normal goods with positive income elasticities (YED), meaning demand increases as income rises. However, on the supply side, the price elasticity of supply (PES) is low in the short term because it is difficult to quickly build new quantum labs. Quantum products have elastic demand at this stage because they are unique and essential for specialised users like governments, research labs, and scientists. For example, Google's Sycamore chip took years and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop because the technology requires clean rooms and advanced engineers. The price elasticities of supply are low, meaning producers cannot easily increase supply; even if prices rise a lot, it is hard to scale quickly. So even if the price of a quantum computer goes up a lot, companies can’t just make 10x more instantly. It takes years and a lot of investment.</p>

        <h2>3. Government Intervention</h2>
        <p>Governments are actively in the quantum area, funding their research. The U.S. National Quantum Initiative Act (2018) gave over $1 billion for national quantum R&D. Similarly, China’s 13th Five-Year Plan included over $10 billion for a quantum research center. These are examples of government subsidies aimed at correcting market failure, since private companies might invest insufficiently, creating high risk+.</p>

        <h2>4. Market Failure & Common Pool Resources</h2>
        <p>The creation of these devices often requires rare earth metals like neodymium and yttrium, used in many devices, or magnets and superconductors. The processes of these elements are from countries like China, Congo Australia, causing pollution and creating health risks. Mining them can cause negative production externalities like pollution or worker harm. The firms overuse the common-pool resources, causing the environment to crash. This is a classic market failure where private benefit is chosen over social welfare. If the resource is global in nature, the only ways to prevent overuse are with environmental rules set by governments and institutions.</p>

        <h2>5. Positive Externalities & Public Goods</h2>
        <p>Quantum research creates huge positive externalities: better weather forecasts, secure banking, faster drug discovery; benefits that help society, not just the buyer. These often are public goods, especially when universities or governments share their findings freely. But because private companies may not want to invest to finance benefits they cannot profit from, the government has a place in supporting innovation through funding or policy. In that case, quantum technology represents one of the reasons markets alone can't always achieve optimal results. That is why public universities, EU Horizon funding, and open science platforms are so critical to drive innovation and welfare.</p>

        <h2>6. Asymmetric Information & Equity</h2>
        <p>Quantum physics is tough to understand. Most users don’t know how quantum encryption or qubits really work, giving tech companies much more information than buyers. This is a clear case of asymmetric information, which may cause mispricing, overhype, or even misinformation. Also, many low-income countries don’t have access to this knowledge. While countries like Germany, Canada, and Japan fund national quantum programs, others are left behind, deepening the global digital divide. Without policy action, quantum may widen inequality, not solve it.</p>
